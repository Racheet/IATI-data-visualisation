Project for Oxford Random Hacks of Kindness.
=========================================

The aim was to visualise IATA data through time and locations. 

More information is available at the [Oxford RHOK wiki page for this project](http://wiki.rhok.org/RHoK_4.0_-_Oxford/Projects/Visualising_Programme_Data)

The app is running at [http://rhok-iati.herokuapp.com](http://rhok-iati.herokuapp.com)

Installation Instructions
=========================

To install a fresh instance of this visualiser you will need to run it on a machine that is running at least node.js 0.4.x. You'll also need to have a local copy of [npm](http://npmjs.org)

To build the project, navigate to the root directory and run:

npm install

To run the project, run:

node app.js

This will launch a copy of the server on localhost:3000, or PROCESS.ENV.PORT if this is different.
